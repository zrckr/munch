Introduction
------------

**MUNCH** is a top-down area-like action game.

You play as *Mr. Munchkin*, a little blue fluffy boy who is always hungry.
However, he has some _enumerous_ problems with the *Litil Divils*, who want
to harm our protagonist. But then how do we fight back?

The main mechanic is allowing you to *roll the dice* for one of 5 random
abilities, which are separated between **good** are **bad**. The effect will be
applied for its custom time to you and removed afterwards.

How to play
